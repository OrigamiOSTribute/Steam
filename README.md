# Steam
###### Original concept by [mrtomone](http://mrtomone.deviantart.com/) can be found [here](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Origami-OS-2-4-2-Concept-Update-556728058) (Redirect's to appropriate DeviantArt pages)

### What is this?
This is a proof-of-concept for a steam client based upon the design from mrtomone (linked above). Only the library view was shown in the concepts so the others pages were (noticeable) designed by me :D

There are some things this can't do because of API limitations. For example, You can't see your current wallet balance outside of the store. Unfortunately this still requires Steam to be installed and running (If it isn't this will launch it when starting a game) because Steam games can't be launch without the Steam client.

### Installing
**TODO: Make instructions :)**
